abstract = {In this paper, the necessary and sufficient conditions for two adjacent Bézier surface patches of arbitrary degrees joining Gn-continuously along a common boundary curve are presented. These conditions are represented directly by the two surface patches, or via an intermediate surface patch. Configurations of the coefficient functions attached to the adjacent Bézier patches are obtained. Based on these results, an algorithm to compute the order of continuity between two given Bézier patches along a common boundary curve is presented. The Gn compatibility conditions which involve the coefficient functions and the control points of the two adjacent Bézier patches are developed. Examples for the construction of G1- and G2-continuous Bézier patches are given to illustrate the conditions developed.}

abstract = {Sets of conditions are derived that are necessary and sufficient for tangent plane continuity between two polynomial or rational Bézier surfaces. The patches may be given in either triangular or rectangular form, and no assumptions are made concerning the relative degrees of the patches; the only assumption is that the patches share common boundary control points (and weights in the case of rational surfaces). The conditions are shown to be minimal in the sense that they are, in general, independent.}

abstract = {The tensor product Bézier patch is currently one of the most widely used models in CAGD for free-form surface modelling. In a piecewise representation the patches are distributed on a mesh. If any piecewise surface has to be modelled using non-degenerate Bézier patches, it is necessary to use a mesh of unrestricted topology, i.e. with any number of patches meeting at a node. In order to obtain a smooth surface the geometric continuities between adjacent patches must be controlled. A lot of research has been devoted to this problem and various solutions have been proposed. This paper reviews the various studies dealing with the G1 smooth connection between adjacent Bézier patches and those dealing with the techniques of free-form surface modelling using Bézier patches. First, the constraints guaranteeing G1 continuity between two adjacent Bézier patches are analysed. This analysis reveals several important geometric properties hidden in these constraints, usually expressed analytically. From these results the G1 smooth connection between N (N > 2) patches meeting at a common corner is studied. The resulting G1 constraints are deduced, and it is shown how to satisfy them in the definition of the control points of the Bézier patches. Degeneration problems around a four-patch corner adjacent to a non-four-patch corner are then analysed, and the supplementary conditions to be satisfied are developed in order to guarantee the G1 continuity around a degenerate four-patch corner. After that, the various methods proposed to model complex surfaces using Bézier patches are reviewed. Based on this analysis, new alternative approaches for modelling free-form G1 continuous surfaces are presented.}

abstract = {In this paper, the constraints on the homogeneous surface belonging to a certain rational surface are derived which are both necessary and sufficient to ensure that the rational surface is nth-order geometric continuous. This gives up the strong restriction that requires the homogeneous surface to be as smooth as the rational surface. Further the conditions for the rectangular rational Bézier patches are developed, and some simple and practical sufficient conditions are presented which might give a valid means for the construction of GCn connecting surfaces.}
